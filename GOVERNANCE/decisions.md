# Cryptographic Architecture Decisions

## Decision QS-001: Algorithm Selection
**Date:** 2026-01-17  
**Status:** Approved  
**Rationale:** Selected NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Round 3 winners for foundation. Kyber for KEM, Dilithium for signatures. Both are lattice-based, providing quantum resistance with relatively small key sizes.

## Decision QS-002: Implementation Scale
**Date:** 2024-01-17  
**Status:** Approved  
**Rationale:** Nano-scale implementation targeting embedded devices with <4KB RAM. Requires stripped-down, memory-optimized implementations.

## Decision QS-003: Dependency Policy
**Date:** 2024-01-17  
**Status:** Approved  
**Rationale:** Zero external dependencies. All crypto implemented in-house with GitDigital governance. Eliminates supply chain attacks.
