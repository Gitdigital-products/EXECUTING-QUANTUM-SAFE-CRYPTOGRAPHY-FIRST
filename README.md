🚀 Overview

This repository implements the first execution layer of the GitDigital Quantum‑Safe Architecture — a modular, verifiable, and governance‑aligned cryptography micro‑module designed for nano‑device networks, micro‑nodes, and quantum‑resilient blockchain infrastructure.

It provides:

- Quantum‑safe key generation  
- Deterministic signing pipelines  
- Nano‑device identity enforcement  
- Micro‑node verification logic  
- Governance‑driven cryptographic policy enforcement  
- Formal verification scaffolding  
- C‑level primitives with Python/Shell adapters  

This module is the cryptographic root of trust for your emerging nano‑scale blockchain and device‑mesh ecosystem.

🧩 Architecture

Core Components

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| src/key_manager.c | Quantum‑safe key generation, rotation, and secure storage logic. |
| adapters/blockchain_signer.c | Signing adapter for ledger‑compatible event batching. |
| GOVERNANCE/ | OGS‑aligned governance rules, policies, and compliance mappings. |
| NANO-DEVICE NETWORK PROTOCOL.md | Identity, handshake, and attestation rules for nano‑devices. |
| QUANTUM-SAFE CRYPTOGRAPHY MICRO-MODULE | High‑level specification for this micro‑module. |
| tests/formal_verification.spec | Formal verification specification for cryptographic correctness. |

🔐 Quantum‑Safe Cryptography

This module adheres to:

- NIST PQC Standards (CRYSTALS‑Kyber, Dilithium, Falcon families)  
- OGS‑CRYPTO‑001 governance requirements  
- Deterministic, auditable cryptographic workflows  
- Nano‑device constraints (low power, low memory, high‑frequency event signing)

Your design philosophy is clear:  
> Cryptography is not a library — it is a governed execution layer.

This repo operationalizes that principle.

---

🛰️ Nano‑Device Network Integration

The included protocol specification defines:

- Device identity bootstrapping  
- Quantum‑safe handshake  
- Event‑level signing  
- Micro‑node batching and validation  
- Ledger‑ready payload formatting  

This ensures every nano‑device event is:

- Authenticated  
- Non‑repudiable  
- Quantum‑resilient  
- Governed by OGS policies  

---

🧪 Testing & Verification

The tests/ directory includes:

- Formal verification specs  
- Deterministic signing tests  
- Key lifecycle validation  
- Governance compliance checks

Future additions will include:

- Fuzzing harness  
- Side‑channel analysis scripts  
- Nano‑device simulation tests
